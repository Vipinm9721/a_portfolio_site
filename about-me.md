# About me
I'm Vipin Maddheshiya, a recent B.Tech. graduate in Computer Science & Engineering with a solid background in software development, 
particularly in web and full-stack development. I've worked on various projects using Python, Django, Java, and Spring-Boot, and 
gained hands-on experience through internships in web and front-end development. I’m passionate about using my technical skills 
and problem-solving abilities to contribute to innovative projects, and I’m excited to apply my expertise in both coding and 
communication in my career.
